**Festify Admin** is a React JS web application for managing the content and
user interactions of the Festify educational multiplatform app (uses React

## üöÄ Getting Started üöÄ

### Prerequisites

Node.js and npm are required to run the project. You can download them from
[here](https://nodejs.org/en/). Also, you need to have a Firebase project with
Firestore, Authentication and Cloud Storage enabled. You can create a new
project from [here](https://console.firebase.google.com/).

Also for the notifications to work you need to have an Expo account and a
project with a server token. You can create a new project from
[here](https://expo.io/).

Email delivery is handled by Resend. You need to create an account and get an
API key from [here](https://resend.com/).

### Clone the repository

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ptaushanov/festify-admin.git
    cd festify-admin
    
    cd client
    npm install

    cd ../server
    npm install
```

### Configure the project

1. Create a `.env` file inside the `client` & `server` folders and copy the
   contents from the example bellow. Fill in the values with your Firebase, Expo
   and Resend credentials.

---

**For the client:**

```env
# Firebase configuration
VITE_API_KEY = 
VITE_AUTH_DOMAIN = 
VITE_PROJECT_ID = 
VITE_STORAGE_BUCKET = 
VITE_MESSAGING_SENDERID = 
VITE_APP_ID = 

# Server connection
VITE_SERVER_URL = "http://localhost:5000"
```

---

**For the server:**

```env
API_KEY = 
AUTH_DOMAIN = 
PROJECT_ID = 
STORAGE_BUCKET = 
MESSAGING_SENDERID = 
APP_ID = 

RESEND_API_KEY = 
EXPO_ACCESS_TOKEN =
```

2. Copy the `serviceAccountKey.json` file from your Firebase project and paste
   it inside the `server` folder. This file is used for the Firebase Admin SDK
   to authenticate with Firebase.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Running the project ‚öôÔ∏è
